					<p>Taking an online course is completely different compared to taking as class in person. Actually, physically being in class should make you feel that you are in a learning environment. As opposed to learning online or from home. Both cases are going to have their distractions.
					In the classroom, there could be other students talking during the lecture, there could be someone in front of you with a video playing on their laptop, the person next to you could be asking you for notes on what was said during a previous part of the lecture. 
					From home, there could be family members in the next room talking loudly, there could be a TV or music being played too loud from another part of the house and possibly pets making noise or asking you for attention. Let’s not forget to mention the device or devices you are using to revise on can be a MASSIVE distraction. Getting a notification popping up on your screen can be extremely distracting. And who could forget the all-important mobile phone that you carry around everywhere. Have a notification popping up on your phone during an online class is Extremely distracting. Nowadays, there takes some serious restraint for a person to not check their phone when they feel or hear that little buzz go off in their pocket.</p>
